    "full_text": "The tragic murder of Charles Kirk has pushed us further down a dangerous path. It‚Äôs another example of how division, chaos, and media-fueled outrage are tearing at the fabric of our society.\n\nBut let his death not be in vain. If anything good can come from this, may it be the outrage that finally acts as a catalyst for change ‚Äî a moment that forces us to demand accountability, reject propaganda, and return to truth.\n\nBecause without change, the cycle of violence and fear will only deepen ‚Äî and that‚Äôs a future none of us should accept.\n\nThe media has become a vicious cycle of division.\n\nThey create conflict, add fuel to the fire, and pit us against each other. Then they sensationalize the chaos ‚Äî the shootings, the killings, the worst of humanity ‚Äî and profit from the ratings and clicks it generates.\n\nThis isn‚Äôt journalism; it‚Äôs propaganda. It‚Äôs disgusting. News needs to go back to being news ‚Äî facts, truth, accountability ‚Äî not a machine designed to divide.\n\nAnd the damage goes deeper: this cycle is eroding our First Amendment freedoms and opportunities for discourse. \n\nBy manufacturing fear and silencing dissent through intimidation, the media makes people afraid to express themselves, afraid to speak truth. That is very, very dangerous ‚Äî because when free speech dies, freedom dies with it.\n\nMy heart goes out to Charles Kirk‚Äôs family. I‚Äôm deeply sorry for their loss ‚Äî and ashamed that humanity has digressed to a place where people must fear for their safety simply for voicing an opinion.\n\nThis is not freedom. This is not the America our First Amendment was meant to protect. And until we demand better, tragedies like this will continue to silence voices and weaken the very foundation of our liberty",
